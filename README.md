TPP Touchscreen Input Assist
============================


Usage
=====

You will either need Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey browser extensions. Once those are installed, use this URL: todo.

Once enabled, the Twitch chat will show "TPPInputAssist" under the text box. Click it to show the settings panel.

When you enable the touchscreen feature, a box will appear on the video. Drag the box over the touchscreen portion of the video using the top handlebar. Then use the bottom handlebar to resize it. When you click within the box, the coordinates will appear in the chat text box.


Compiling
=========

To compile the script on Linux, install Haxe 3.2. Then run the makefile with `make` and the JavaScript output will be in the same directory.
